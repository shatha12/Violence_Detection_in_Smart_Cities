# Violence Detection in Smart Cities

## Goal of the Project
he aim of this project is to develop automatic system to detect dangerous situations Such as fighting, brawls, robberies, and more.

 ## Start building Simple Neural Network (baseline)


Three sequential layers with different activation function (__relu__) was added
