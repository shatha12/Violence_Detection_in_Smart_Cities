# Violence Detection in Smart Cities

## Goal of the Project
The aim of this project is to develop automatic system to detect dangerous situations Such as fighting, brawls, robberies, and more.

 ## Start building Simple Neural Network (baseline)


Three sequential layers with activation function (__relu__) was added

> The above figure represent the loss 


<img src = 'image2.png' width = '500' />

> The above figure represent the accuarcy

## Future Work
- Improve accuracy scores
- Using Transfer Learning (VGG16)
